# Yelp api exploration

This is an assignment in the data scientist course at BGU university.

We chose Yelp as it is not as "remarkable" as facebook and twitter, yet it can provide some intersting data
about the preferences of pepole, and also provide spatial data. 

The main idea was to gather data from a public api, and show some basic insights about the data.  
For example:
- Basic graphs
- Correlation
- Visualizing data on a map

## Executing
- First, change the `wd` variable in [report-exploring-yelp-api.Rmd](report-exploring-yelp-api.Rmd) to point your local repository.
- If you need to get the data from Yelp, check the comment in the top of [report-exploring-yelp-api.Rmd](report-exploring-yelp-api.Rmd).
- Then import [report-exploring-yelp-api.Rmd](report-exploring-yelp-api.Rmd) to `RStudio` and `"knit"` it.
